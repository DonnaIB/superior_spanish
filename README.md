[Superior Spanish - Live site](https://superior-spanish.herokuapp.com/)


*Note: This is an extension to the fictional organisation (Dublin Intercambio) created for my earlier Code Institute milestone projects.*

## Introduction
The organisers of Dublin Intercambio want to create an e-commerce site that allows that provides the opportunity for their memebers to purchase Spanish learning resources to truely enhance their Spanish. The majority of their members have at least an intermediate level of Spansih but are looking to take it to the next level. Moving from B1 to B2 or from B2 to C1 level is a big challenge, it requires dedication, motivatation and the of course the right resources to ensure success. 

Listening to the frustation of their members who had hit that intermediate plataue, a common phenomenon for language learners, the team at Dublin Intercambio decided to create some fanstastic resources, dedicated to supporting learning to move past the plataue and reach their language learning goals and they need a site while they can sell these resources as well as their classes.


                                                        ***************************************


## Scope 

Create a simple, intuitive, and responsive website that allows people to browse the services and products that are available, purchase these services, and create an account to save their payment details for future see their order history and access their purchases.

The structure should adhere to convention and be simple and intuitive, ensuring the user always knows where they are, how they got there and how to get back to 
where they started.

The design should be simple, utilising the same colour palette, as the other websites in the Dublin Intercambio site. However this time the design will focus mainly on the red and yellow from the colour paette with white and a dark grey used as contrasting colours when needed. The green from the palette will be used for any success messages.

Any addition features or functionally are out of scope at this stage.

User goals:
* To get information about what the products being sold.
* To get information about the person/company selling the product.
* To easily buy and enjoy the product.
* To create an account and save their payments details.


Website owners goals:
* To build on and expand the commuity of language learnings that are part of Dublin Intercambio.
* To create an easy and intuative way for users to buy their resources and services.
* To encourage users to continue interacting with the wider langaage learning community created by Dublin Intercambio.
* To build in the ability for admins to add, edit and delete products and services.

### Design (Wireframes and Mockups): 
The design is simple, modern, fully responsive and has a connection to the [Dublin Intercambio](https://donnaib.github.io/dublin_intercambio/) site from my Ms1 project, this connection will be achieved by utilising the same color palette and logo throughout. As before the inspiration for this colour palette was to harness the Spanish connection and influence of the project.

I am aware that yellow can sometimes be a problematic colour, however it remains an important element of the design due the fact that it is a key colour of the Spansih flag. With this in mind special I was careful to utilize the color in a way that added to the design of the site, but didn't not compromise the accessibility of the site.

Boostrap and Material Design icons are used throughout to realise the simple, modern and fully responsive design.

ADD IMAGE HERE OF THE COLOUR PALETTE.

I used Balsamiq to create detailed Wireframes for mobile and desktop site, for tablet devices the layout will follow either the mobile or desktop views depending on the size of the screen.

## Features

### Pages 

##### Home


##### 



### Site Features 
Every page on this site also incorporates the following features:
* A logo in the top left hand corner, that not only forms part of the branding and design of the site but also as is consistent with a user's expectations, clicking the logo will return the user to the home page of the site.
* A responsive, collapsible navigation bar, allowing users to easily navigate the site on any device.
* A responsive footer.

### Possible Features to Implement in Future
* If more products or services are added to the site then I would look at adding a shopping bag to the site.
* Could possibly add reviews or testimonials to the site in the future.
* Feature to keep track of how many classes a user has purchased and how many have been use. Running total showing in user profile and admin option for a superuser to reduce the total by one every time a class has happened.


## Technologies Used for building this site
- This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages.
- Gitpod was used an the IDE for building the site.
- **Bootstrap4** was used to assist with the structure, responsiveness and browser compatibility of the site. 
- BootstrapCDN was used to provide icons from **Font Awesome**. 
- **Material Design** was used to provide some of the icons in the nav and the product icons.
- **Google fonts** was used to style the website fonts.
- **jQuery** to reference Javascript needed for the responsive navbar.
- **Popper.js** reference Javascript needed for the responsive navbar.

## Testing

I tested the site in the following ways:

1. Initially I used the inspector tool to test the site in all the screen sizes and devices available in the Chrome developer tool.  In addition to this I also tested it on live devices, including but not limited to iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, MotoG7. 

2. I also tested my code using the validator tools for both my HTML [W3C HTML Validator Tool](https://validator.w3.org/), CSS [W3C CSS Validator Tool](https://validator.w3.org/) and I also checked my JavaScript code using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) Running my code through these tools highlighted a few issues with syntax which have been fixed.

Screen shots of the HTML & CSS validator results can be viewed below, as you can see there were no errors detected.

![HTML Validation Report - Contact](documentation/validation/validator_contact.png)
![CSS Validation Report](documentation/validation/validator_css.png)

3. All links were tested to ensure there were no broken links and that all links to external sites open in a new tab.

4. In addition to testing with the inspector tool, real devices and validation tools, I also work through a series of test cases, to ensure that the site met the users stories and that any functionality that was added worked as intended.

### Accessibility
In addition to all the above testing I also checked my site with accessibility tools in the inspector. ![Accessibility Check Screenshot](documentation/validation/accessibility_check.png)

### Bugs & Issues

* When connecting my database I accidentally commited my DATABASE_URL to github. I realised what I had done and knew that I had to fix this error.  I deleted the DB I had already created and created a new one so that they details that were in Gitpod were rendered useless and I started again with a new DB and made sure not to commit that to Github.  

* I deployed early as advised but this seemed to cause a migration issue. I worked with a channel lead to help debug an error I was seeing in live but not locally. I was getting a 500 error when I tried to access admin in the live site but no issues locally. In the end I had to temporarilty add my Postgres DB detailts for settings.py and check for a migration, there was one waiting to run, I ran it and that solved the issue.

## Deployment.

		os.environ['STRIPE_WH_SECRET'] = "< add your key details here >"
		
11. Check that the env.py file is listed in the .gitignore file

12. Run the app locally by typing 'python3 manage.py runserver' in the terminal


### Heroku Deployment 

1. Create a requirements.txt and Procfile:
	
	 - 'pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt'
	 - 'echo web: python run.py > Procfile'
	

2. Push the above files to your Github account
3. Log into Heroku and create a new app: 
	
	- Click 'New' and select 'Create new app'
	- Choose a name for the app (remember this must be a unique name)
	- Choose your region
